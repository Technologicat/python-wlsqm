class ExpertSolver:
    """Advanced API / "expert mode" in the LAPACK sense, with separate prepare and solve stages.

Typical usage is:

s = ExpertSolver(...)  # Instantiating the solver creates the necessary internal objects and allocates memory.
s.prepare(...)         # If the geometry stays constant, it is enough to prepare just once; this generates and prepares the problem matrices.
s.solve(...)           # Then it is possible to solve many times with different data (fk); this solves all unknowns with given data fk and current geometry.

This is very useful when one wishes to perform many fits with the same geometry, but each time with new data,
since the expensive prepare step needs to be performed only once.

Note that if the geometry changes (i.e. the points move), their internal xi values must be updated.
This can be done by calling prepare() again to re-generate the matrices using the updated geometry.

Although in this case the prepare step must be performed again, this still has the advantage of re-using the already allocated memory
(avoiding memory fragmentation and saving some processing time), since the other settings do not change.

Once an ExpertSolver is instantiated, the settings given as constructor parameters cannot be changed for that instance!

This implies that even if the points move, their number of neighbors (xk used in the fitting) must not change!

If you need to do that, destroy the old ExpertSolver instance and create a new one. This limitation is due to the way memory allocation is managed.

Constructor.

dimension        : in, number of space dimensions (1, 2 or 3)

order            : in, array of shape (ncases,), the order of the surrogate polynomial to be fitted for each problem instance (0,1,2,3 or 4) (dtype np.int32)
knowns           : in, array of shape (ncases,), the knowns bitmask for each problem instance (see wlsqm.fitter.defs) (dtype np.int64)
weighting_method : in, array of shape (ncases,), the weighting method to use for each problem instance; each entry must be one of the constants wlsqm.fitter.defs.WEIGHT_* (dtype np.int32)
ncases           : in, number of problem instances
algorithm        : in, one of the ALGO_* constants in wlsqm.fitter.defs
do_sens          : in, boolean: whether to perform sensitivity analysis. If False, then in the solve() step, "sens" can be None.
max_iter         : in. If algorithm == ALGO_ITERATIVE, the maximum number of refinement iterations to perform. Unused if algorithm == ALGO_BASIC.
ntasks           : in, number of threads to use for computation
debug            : in, boolean. If True, compute the 2-norm condition number of the (scaled) problem matrix for each problem instance (can be slow). If False (default), skip it.
host             : in, ExpertSolver instance to use as host for guest mode. (Default None, guest mode off.)

                       If different datasets to be fitted live on the exact same geometry, this can be used to save both memory and time
                       by siphoning geometry data (problem matrices) off an already prepare()'d ExpertSolver instance.

                       The geometry must be exactly the same in the host ExpertSolver instance as in the ExpertSolver instance being created.
                       Also dimension, nk, order, knowns, weighting_method, debug must be the same.

                       Note that "geometry" includes both xi,yi.zi (point "xi") and the neighbor set (points "xk").
                       This cannot be checked automatically in this constructor, because the geometry is only specified at prepare() time!

                       In guest mode (host is not None), prepare() must still be called for the guest instance, too - it initializes the "xi" data for each Case instance.

                       IMPORTANT: Guest mode directly uses the same physical copy of the data as the host instance, saving memory. Thus when using guest mode,
                       the calling code must make sure that the host instance stays alive at least as long as its guest instances, or hope for a crash.

mode : 'nearest'    = for each point in x, use the local model whose reference point "xi" is nearest to that point.

       The result will be piecewise continuous in each Voronoi cell, with jumps across cell boundaries.
       Note that these cells are not even known explicitly! (If you need them, consider using scipy.spatial.Voronoi .)

       NOTE: in 'nearest' mode, this function multi-threads automatically using self.ntasks threads.

       'continuous' = for each point in x, average over all local models that have their origin inside a radius r from that point.

       A weight function is used, with more weight given to models whose origin is closer to the point. The weight falls off to zero
       exactly at r. The result will be continuous over the whole domain.

       NOTE: in 'continuous' mode, the computation is always single-threaded, and also very slow.

r    : averaging radius for mode='continuous'. (No default, because no sane default can exist; depends on the point cloud.)

diff : Interpolate a derivative of the function instead of the function value itself. (The default is to interpolate the function value.)

       One of the constants i3_* (in 3D), i2_* (in 2D) or i1_* (in 1D) in wlsqm.fitter.defs.

       See wlsqm.fitter.interp.interpolate_fit() for details.

I    : If mode='nearest': override which local model to use for each point in x, skipping the search for the nearest local model,
       thus making the interpolation run significantly faster.

       This is useful for re-interpolating a model with updated data values, if you wish to evaluate again at the same points x.
       To obtain this data, see I_out in the return value below.

Return value: tuple (out, I_out) where
        out   = function value (or derivative value, depending on "diff")
        I_out = if mode='nearest', index of local model used for each point in x (array of shape (nx,), dtype np.long).
                This can be passed back in as "I".

                if mode='continuous', this is always None (i.e. currently not supported).
