# class Case:
#################################################

# Constructor.
#
# This class is only intended to be instantiated from a Python thread.
#
# manager: an already existing CaseManager object to use, to share the memory allocator among a set of cases.
#          The cases must have the same dimension, do_sens, iterative.
#
#          If null, an Allocator will be created locally.
#
# host:    for guest mode, an existing Case object to use. The geometry data (o2r,r2o,c,w,A,row_scale,col_scale,ipiv) will be borrowed off the host,
#          and no local copies will be created.
#
#          This can be used to save both memory and time when different fields (in an IBVP problem) live on the exact same geometry.
#          "Geometry" includes both xi,yi.zi (point "xi") and the neighbor set (points "xk"; see wlsqm.fitter.impl.make_c_?D()).
#
#          Thus, the host Case instance must have the exact same parameters (and geometry!) as the Case instance being created.
#          "Parameters" include  dimension, order, nk, knowns, weighting_method.
#
#          The parameter match is not checked! See wlswm2_expert.ExpertSolver for correct usage.
#          (It does some rudimentary checking, but does not check the geometry.)
#
#          When using guest mode, the calling code must make sure the host instance stays alive at least as long as its guest instances,
#          or hope for a crash.
#
#          If null, the geometry data will be allocated locally.
