    """def interpolate_fit( xi, double[::1] fi, int dimension, int order, x, int diff=0 ):

Interpolate the fit to given points x.

This calls the C API to interpolate the model; thus the result is guaranteed to be identical
to the internal model interpolation performed during fitting with iterative refinement.

Fused multiply-add (fma()) is used to reduce roundoff.

xi    : in, the origin of the fit; (x0,y0,z0) (double[:]) in 3D, (x0,y0) (double[:]) in 2D, or (x0) (double) in 1D
fi    : in, fit coefficients (double[::1])
order : in, degree of the surrogate polynomial (int)
x     : in, points to which to interpolate the model; x[k,:] = (x,y,z) in 3D, x[k,:] = (x,y) in 2D, or x[:] = (x) in 1D
diff  : in, one of the i1_* (if dimension==1), i2_* (if dimension==2) or i3_* (if dimension==3) constants in wlsqm.fitter.defs.

        If dimension==1:

        i1_F   : interpolate function value f (default)
        i1_X   : interpolate df/dx
        i1_X2  : interpolate d2f/dx2
        i1_X3  : ...
        i1_X4

        If dimension==2:

        i2_F   : interpolate function value f (default)
        i2_X   : interpolate df/dx
        i2_Y   : interpolate df/dy
        i2_X2  : interpolate d2f/dx2
        i2_XY  : interpolate d2f/dxdy
        i2_Y2  : interpolate d2f/dy2
        i2_X3  : ...
        i2_X2Y
        i2_XY2
        i2_Y3
        i2_X4
        i2_X3Y
        i2_X2Y2
        i2_XY3
        i2_Y4

        For dimension==3, see wlsqm.fitter.defs (there are 35 constants for the 3D case).

        Derivatives of order up to that of the model order are available.
        E.g. if order=2, then up to second-order derivatives are available.

        This can be used to obtain the derivatives at a general point
        (i.e. not only at the origin of the fit; that information
         is already contained in the coefficients, since the model
         is a polynomial).

        Note that in general, the higher the derivative order,
        the less accurate the result will be. This is due to the
        fact that the fitting error mostly concentrates into
        the higher-order terms.

Return value : rank-1 array, function value at each x.

The returned lambda is vectorized in the sense that it can be called with an np.array of coordinates.

Note that the same xi, dimension and order must be passed here as for the model fitting.

fi[] must be the coefficients output by one of the fitting functions (see wlsqm.fitter.simple.fit_*()).

The parameter "diff" allows lambdifying a derivative of the model instead of the function itself.
See interpolate_fit() for the valid values. The default is to lambdify the function itself.
